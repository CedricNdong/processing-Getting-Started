# processing-Getting-Started
Processing (https://processing.org) is, on the one hand, a Java programme library primarily for graphic programming and, on the other hand, a development environment for creating very simple graphic-oriented programmes. Processing is used to program in Java, but the development environment has made minor changes to the Java syntax, so that at first the programming does not feel like Java at all, but rather like JShell. This is intentional, as Processing wants to provide easy access to graphical programming for creative people, for example. Java professionals, however, have been able to make full use of language constructs and libraries from Java 17 since Processing 4.0. Processing has become so popular that there are also implementations for other programming languages.
